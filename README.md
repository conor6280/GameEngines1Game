# Descripton
An infinite runner game in a 3D enviroment where the obstacles are meshes that react to the music playing in the background and are procedurally generated in a square. The player is constantly being chased by a ghost that will B-line for the player at all times, the ghost is also faster than the player so they must run through booster rings to keep away from him.

# Instructions
WASD for movement 
Mouse to look around
Left Shift to sprint

# How it Works
The meshes are manipulated planes, spawned in with procedural generation and their height is controlled by the loudness of the music.
The enemy runs on Nav Mesh
The Player uses the controller from standard assets to move.

# What I'm Most Proud of
I am most proud of how the meshes react to the music

# Old Proposal
For my game i'm going to finish a game i started last year where the player character is chased around a procedurally generated city by an enemy who is far faster, to escape the player must find speed boost rings that randomly spawn around the map. The player will have 3 hitpoints, if they are hit the enemy will be teleported back to its spawn to chase you down again.
